An electrical interface to Digitrax Loconet

LocoShield Protoboard

This protoboard takes power from a regulated 5v supply, sends a clean
digital packet waveform (RXData) by default to the Arduino's Digital Input
Compare pin (Uno: pin D8), and accepts a packet waveform for sending
(TXData) (Uno: on digital pin D7).


The board can be populated with a 4-pin breadboard
friendly header or 0.100 screw terminals - or soldered jumper wires.
The breadboard header contains power (5v & gnd) and the TXData &amp;
RXData signals.
