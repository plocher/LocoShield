An electrical interface to Digitrax Loconet

Discrete Component / PTH version

Added jumpers to decouple RX & TX from Arduino shield pins 8 & 7 in case of conflicts
Fixed LED Polarity

  * Changes
  *  * Rev 1.1A - BROKEN - DO NOT USE - The traces connecting to the IC chip short out the pads on the chip.
  *  * Rev 1.1B - BROKEN - DO NOT USE - Does not have termination or support for LEO
  *  * Rev 1.1C - Latest PTH version

This version supports user selection of the TX pin, but not the RX pin.  As such, it only works on the UNO and not the Leo.
See the 1.4 version if you can assemble surface mount parts, otherwise the 1.0 Protoboard may better meet your needs.
