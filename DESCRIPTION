An electrical interface to Digitrax Loconet

LocoShield Protoboard

This first version  had the silkscreen for the
LED backwards, with "+" and "-" reversed.  The "+" lead should be
towards the RJ12 connector, the "-" should be closest to the edge
of the board.


If the LED does not light when power is applied with no Loconet Cables attached, reverse the LED.
